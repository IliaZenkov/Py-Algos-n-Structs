# Py-Algos-n-Structs
A comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms written in Python. Most are compiled from around the internet from code snippets and repositories I've encountered during my Python self-study, while some I've rewritten to better understand. 

I use this as a reminder to myself of the algorithm's I've found useful (thanks to LeetCode).
